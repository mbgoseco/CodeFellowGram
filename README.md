Welcome to my Code Fellows themed social media app! Using Azure blob storage, SQL databases, and Razor Pages, users can share their life experience through pictures and captions, as well as leave comments to start a discussion. Users can create new posts, or edit existing ones, as well as delete a post. Comments can be created and are unique to each post. Pictures are uploaded from the user to the Azure blob container where they are stored and retreived via URL. Each post object, along with its comments, are stored in the SQL database.
